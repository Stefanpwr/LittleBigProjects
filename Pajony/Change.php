    Rape and sexual assault have been defined to include the different natures of unlawful, forced activities upon another person. More specifically, persons are said to have committed rape if they have committed a sexual act upon another person by (a) the exertion of unlawful force (b) exertion of force that has caused or would be likely to cause the death of or serious harm to another person (c) placing or threatening to place the person in fear of being kidnapped, subject to death, or subject to grave bodily harm (d) rendering the person unconscious, or (e) administering without the knowledge of the person, or through force or threat, any substance that can substantially render the person incapable of assessing or controlling conduct. When such act or acts are proven, the guilty will be punished in accordance with the decision of a court-martial.

    Persons accused of sexual assault are those who:

    (1) Have committed a sexual act upon another person by:

    (a) the threatening the person or using the weapon of fear (b) causing the person any form of bodily harm (c) fraudulently representing the sexual act as necessary to serving a professional purpose (d) creating a false belief that the accused is another person;

    (2) Have committed a sexual act upon another person who is unconscious, asleep or unaware of the occurrence of the act

    (3) Have committed the sexual act upon another person in a situation where the person is incapable of consenting to the act, as a result of (a) intoxication or impairment by a drug or other substance (b) a physical or mental disability, of which the accused has full or reasonable knowledge.

    Aggravated sexual contact and abusive sexual contact also fall under Article 120. The former is an offense by a person who has committed sexual contact upon another person, and does not satisfy the conditions of rape (subsection a). The latter is an offense by a person who has committed sexual contact upon another person, and does not satisfy the conditions of sexual assault (subsection b).

    When a person being prosecuted under this section has been charged with proof of threat, it is not necessary to prove that the person actually had the intention to carry out the act or possessed the ability to commit the same. Also, marriage cannot be cited as a defense under this section.

    POTENTIAL SENTENCES FOR OFFENSES UNDER ARTICLE 120 RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT GENERALLY
    This year, the House of Representatives passed a measure to enforce a mandatory minimum sentence of two years imprisonment, and dismissal or dishonorable discharge for servicemen convicted of sexual assault or rape under the UCMJ. In the event that the measure becomes part of a larger bill, accused servicemen will face a tougher court-martial.

    In any case, strict punishment is reserved for offenses under Article 120. For each section, depending on the nature of crime and the outcome of the court-martial, a death sentence is the harshest punishment that can be delivered, followed by lifelong incarceration, and imprisonment for a certain number of years (depending on the ruling). The counsel of a reliable military lawyer can be extremely helpful in softening the ruling or even getting a clean chit, based on the nature and specifics of the case.

    Rape: The maximum penalty for rape is death. Or the accused can be awarded with life imprisonment. Other possible punishments are dishonorable discharge and bad conduct discharge. Individuals accused of rape also face the forfeiture of their total pay and allowance.

    The repercussion of dishonorable and bad conduct discharge: Basically, a military discharge releases you from your obligation to continue serving the armed forces. Dishonorable discharge is awarded for acts the military deems reprehensible. Individuals who have been dishonorably discharged do not receive any, and often struggle to find employment in the civilian sector. The US federal law also forfeits their right to own firearms. Bad conduct discharge is awarded to enlisted military members as punishment for misconduct. It is often always accompanied by jail time in military prison. Individuals who have been discharged due to bad conduct must forfeit all their veteran's benefits.

    As you can see, rape is not let off lightly in the armed services, and the guilty will have to bear strict punishment for his/her actions. So far, under the UCMJ, only one serviceman has been executed for rape – in 1961, Private John Arthur Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill a 11-year old girl in Austria. A death sentence was also awarded to Earnest L. Ransom in 1957 – he had been convicted of the rape and premeditated murder of a 14-year old Korean girl.

    Note: A revision undertaken in 2007 for rape (subsection 'a' of Article 120) requires the accused party to prove that the accuser consented to the sexual act. Previously, the requirement for prosecutors was to prove that the sexual contact was forced on the accuser, without his/her consent. Placing the burden of proof on the accused no doubt complicates matters.

    Unfortunately, families of the accused also suffer a long ordeal culminating with the final verdict, which must be respected and accepted. It doesn't have to be all doom and gloom – your military lawyer can protect your rights in a situation where all fingers are firmly pointed in your direction.

    Aggravated Sexual Assault: Individuals convicted of this offense face dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge, and confinement of 30 years. They also face the forfeiture of their total pay and allowance.
